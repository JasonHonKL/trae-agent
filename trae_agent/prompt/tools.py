BASHTOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Run commands in a bash shell
* When invoking this tool, the contents of the "command" parameter does NOT need to be XML-escaped.
* You have access to a mirror of common linux and python packages via apt and pip.
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user.
* To inspect a particular line range of a file, e.g. lines 10-25, try 'sed -n 10,25p /path/to/the/file'.
* Please avoid commands that may produce a very large amount of output.
* Please run long lived commands in the background, e.g. 'sleep 10 &' or start a server in the background.
"""

EDITTOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file !!! If you know that the `path` already exists, please remove it first and then perform the `create` operation!
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`
"""

JSONEDID_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Tool for editing JSON files with JSONPath expressions
* Supports targeted modifications to JSON structures using JSONPath syntax
* Operations: view, set, add, remove
* JSONPath examples: '$.users[0].name', '$.config.database.host', '$.items[*].price'
* Safe JSON parsing and validation with detailed error messages
* Preserves JSON formatting where possible

Operation details:
- `view`: Display JSON content or specific paths
- `set`: Update existing values at specified paths
- `add`: Add new key-value pairs (for objects) or append to arrays
- `remove`: Delete elements at specified paths

JSONPath syntax supported:
- `$` - root element
- `.key` - object property access
- `[index]` - array index access
- `[*]` - all elements in array/object
- `..key` - recursive descent (find key at any level)
- `[start:end]` - array slicing

SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_TOOL = """A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached
